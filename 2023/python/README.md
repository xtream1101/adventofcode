# [Advent of Code - 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)

## Intro

> Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.
> You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.
> Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
