# 2019 Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/2019/

Each day will have the following files:
- `input.txt`: The inputs given to solve the problem
- `n-1.py`: `n` is the day. This is part1's answer. This code may not be the most efficient or clean, but it was the state of the code when I first got the answer
- `n-2.py`: Save as above, but for part 2
- `final.py`: This is the cleaned up code and will run parts 1 & 2 for that day. When I get around to it I like to have a proper version that has clean and documented code.
